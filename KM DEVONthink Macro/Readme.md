###Keyboard Maestro Macro to Rename a File in DEVONthink and Add Tags ###


This KM Macro can be used to rename a file in DEVONthink and add tags.

1. Double-click the file:
>Name and Tag DEVONthink Document.kmmacros
2. Assign a trigger to the macro (the default is **..fn**)
3. In DEVONthink, click into the name of a document until it is selected (highlighted)
4. Type the KM trigger
5. Fill in the fields
	* The only required field is <name> and the macro will terminate if you leave the name at the default
	* All other fields are optional
	* If you enter tags, separate them with a semicolon (no spaces)
	* Do not use punctuation unless you mean to use punctuation

This is experimental.  Use at your own risk.
